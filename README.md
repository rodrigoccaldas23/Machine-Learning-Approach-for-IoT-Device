# Machine-Learning-Approach-for-IoT-Device


Abstractâ€”IoT device is considered a device that is intended to perform a specific task such as a sense sleep monitor, a security camera or a smart speaker. We are thus surrounded by these devices which makes it easy for any unknown device to connect to the network without being invited.
Therefore, it is essential to know which devices are connected to our network to protect us from any kind of privacy invasion or malware attack.
Our work consists on a machine learning algorithm to identify different IoT Camera devices and brands by analyzing packet characteristics and features present in traffic captures made available by the University of New South Wales (UNSW) [1]. The results obtained during the experimental phase were quite positive, in the order of 96%, which shows that the algorithm can predict with great precision to which type of device the packets belong based on their extracted characteristics.
